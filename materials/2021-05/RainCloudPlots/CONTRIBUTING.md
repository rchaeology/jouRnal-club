# Contributing to RainCloud Plots

The point of our tutorial is to **help you visualise your data that is both beautiful *and* statistically valid**. We hope that the preprint and the tutorials in this repository will make that as easy as possible.

## Contributing through GitHub

[git][git] is a really useful tool for version control. [GitHub][github] sits on top of git and supports collaborative and distributed working.

We know that it can be daunting to start using git and GitHub if you haven't worked with them in the past, but Kirstie is here to help you figure out any of the jargon or confusing instructions you encounter! :heart:

In order to contribute via GitHub you'll need to set up a free account and sign in. Here are some [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) to help you get going. Remember that you can ask us any questions you need to along the way.

### Writing in markdown

GitHub has a helpful page on [getting started with writing and formatting on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).

Most of the writing that you'll do will be in [Markdown][markdown]. You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub to render the text with a little bit of formatting. For example you could write words as bold (`**bold**`), or in italics (`*italics*`), or as a [link][rick-roll] (`[link](https://https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)`) to another webpage.

### Making a change with a pull request

We appreciate all contributions to the RainCloudPlots codebase and tutorials. **THANK YOU** for helping us build this useful resource. :sparkles::star2::dizzy:

The following steps are a guide to help you contribute in a way that will be easy for everyone to review and accept with ease  :sunglasses:.

#### 1. Comment on an existing issue or open a new issue referencing your addition

This allows other members of the RainCloud Plots team to confirm that you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.

[This blog][dont-push-pull-request] is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.

#### 2. [Fork][github-fork] the [RainCloudPlots][raincloudplots-repo] to your profile

This is now your own unique copy of the RainCloudPlots repository. Changes here won't affect anyone else's work, so it's a safe space to explore edits to the code!

Make sure to [keep your fork up to date][github-syncfork] with the master repository, otherwise you can end up with lots of dreaded [merge conflicts][github-mergeconflicts].

#### 3. Make the changes you've discussed

Try to keep the changes focused. If you submit a large amount of work in all in one go it will be much more work for whomever is reviewing your pull request. [Help them help you][jerry-maguire] :wink:

If you feel tempted to "branch out" then please make a [new branch][github-branches] and a [new issue][raincloudplots-issues] to go with it.

#### 4. Submit a [pull request][github-pullrequest]

A member of the RainCloud Plots team will review your changes to confirm that they can be merged into the main codebase.

A [review][github-review] will probably consist of a few questions to help clarify the work you've done. Keep an eye on your github notifications and be prepared to join in that conversation.

You can update your [fork][github-fork] of the BIDS Starter Kit [repository][raincloudplots-repo] and the pull request will automatically update with those changes. You don't need to submit a new pull request when you make a change in response to a review.

GitHub has a [nice introduction][github-flow] to the pull request workflow, but please get in touch if you have any questions :balloon:.

## Thank you!

You're awesome. :wave::smiley:
